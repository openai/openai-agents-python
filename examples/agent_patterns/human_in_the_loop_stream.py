"""Human-in-the-loop example with streaming.

This example demonstrates the human-in-the-loop (HITL) pattern with streaming.
The agent will pause execution when a tool requiring approval is called,
allowing you to approve or reject the tool call before continuing.

The streaming version provides real-time feedback as the agent processes
the request, then pauses for approval when needed.
